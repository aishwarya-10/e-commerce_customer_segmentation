# E-Commerce Customer Segmentation

## Overview
Leveraging a rich dataset of orders and brand searches from over 30,000 customers, I built a customer segmentation model. This model identifies customer brand preferences, enabling personalized marketing strategies.

## Data
The data was collected from a well-known e-commerce website over a period based on the customer's search profile.
|__Column__| Description |
| :--- |:--- |
|__Cust_ID__| Unique numbering for customers |
|__Gender__| Gender of the customers |
|__Orders__| Number of orders placed by the customer in the past|
|__Others__| Number of times customers have searched the brands |

## Data Exploration

### Distribution of Gender
Gender analysis of the dataset shows that female customers dominate in E-commerce purchases.

### Distribution of Orders
The data showcases a range of customer engagement, with some placing orders (1-12) and a significant group (around 5,000) focusing on brand research without converting to purchases. This highlights a potential opportunity for targeted marketing strategies.

### Customer Views vs Brands
The chart visualizes the distribution of browsing activity across different brands. Each brand is represented on the y-axis, while the x-axis shows the corresponding number of times customers browsed that particular brand. This helps understand which brands generate the most customer interest.
